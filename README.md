# Accident Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Accident Detection CNN is a project aimed at detecting accidents using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository contains the implementation of a CNN model trained to detect accidents from images.

## Overview

This project utilizes a CNN architecture trained on a custom dataset containing images of various accident scenarios. The trained model can predict whether an image contains an accident or not. It can be used for real-time monitoring of traffic cameras or CCTV footage to alert authorities or relevant personnel in case of accidents.

## Features

- Accurate accident detection using deep learning techniques.
- Flexible and easy-to-use model for integration into existing systems.
- Fast inference suitable for real-time applications.

## Installation

To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/NVS-MIT-SHRIKANTSHINDE/Accident-Detection-CNN.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd Accident-Detection-CNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Prepare your dataset or use the provided example dataset.
4. Train the model using the provided scripts or pre-trained weights.
5. Use the trained model for inference on new images or video streams.
